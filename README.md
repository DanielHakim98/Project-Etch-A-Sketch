# Project-Etch-A-Sketch
This is gonna be my fifth projects under The Odin Project course.
It's gonna be tough because I'm really sure that I'm gonna google a lot and stuck a lot.
But it'd pay off at the end because I'll learn new skills and become more competent in front-end development languagues.
